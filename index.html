        <h1>Hindi OCR</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, which is a technology to recognize text in images of scanned documents and photos. With OCR, you can convert painted text in images into editable, searchable, indexable, and storable document. Applications of OCR include data entry for business documents such as invoices, bank statements, bills, business cards, receipt, mails, passport and IDs, automatic license plate recognition, conversion of scanned books into searchable documents, text to speech for blind and visually impaired users, and much more.
            Hindi OCR is basically a model which is used to recognize handwritten Hindi (Devanagari) characters.</p><br><br>

        <br><br><p>Hindi (हिन्दी) is an Indo-Aryan language, and it is the first most spoken in northern India and official language together with English in Government of India. Hindi arose as a form of Sanskrit and emerged in the 7th century. It is related to Standard Urdu except for some differences in vocabulary.
