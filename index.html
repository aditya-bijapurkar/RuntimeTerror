        <h1>Hindi OCR</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, which is a technology to recognize text in images of scanned documents and photos. With OCR, you can convert painted text in images into editable, searchable, indexable, and storable document. Applications of OCR include data entry for business documents such as invoices, bank statements, bills, business cards, receipt, mails, passport and IDs, automatic license plate recognition, conversion of scanned books into searchable documents, text to speech for blind and visually impaired users, and much more.
            Hindi OCR is basically a model which is used to recognize handwritten Hindi (Devanagari) characters.</p><br><br>

        <br><br><p>Hindi (हिन्दी) is an Indo-Aryan language, and it is the first most spoken in northern India and official language together with English in Government of India. Hindi arose as a form of Sanskrit and emerged in the 7th century. It is related to Standard Urdu except for some differences in vocabulary. It is also understood easily in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal. Furthermore, Persian and Arabic influence can be easily seen in the Hindi language through significant similar features. Hindi is written in Devanagari script, and vocabulary mostly contains Sanskrit words.</p>
        <br><p>The Devanagari script comprises of 47 primary alphabets, 14 vowels, 33 consonants, and 10 digits which have round shapes within square outlines.</p>

                <h2>Convolutional neural network </h2><br><br>
                <p>Computer Vision and pattern recognition is a major growing field in area of image processing. In that Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) plays major role in computer vision. CNN is working on many applications in Image Classification and it is the core of most Computer Vision and pattern recognition systems today, from automatic tagging of photo in Face books to self-driving cars, recognizes digits, alpha-numerals, traffic signal boards, and the other object class. We used five layered Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model. On them one layers for convolutional, one layers for max pooling or sub sampling, one Flatten layer which converts 2D array into 1D array and finally two fully connected layers for classification. The initial layer is convolutional (Conv2D) layer has 32 output mapping and the next max pooling layer has 14 output mapping.</p>
